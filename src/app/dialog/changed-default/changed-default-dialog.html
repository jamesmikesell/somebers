<h2 mat-dialog-title>Auto Clear Update</h2>

<div mat-dialog-content>
  <p>
    Rows, columns, and color groups now clear automatically once all required
    cells are selected. Any remaining uncleared optional cells in that set will
    be cleared for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    This change keeps play moving quicker. You can turn off Auto Clear in
    Settings if you prefer the tougher, manual approach.
