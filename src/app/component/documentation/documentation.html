    Welcome to <em>Some Numbers</em>, or as Tony calls 'em, "Somebers". Though
    that's usually only after he's had somebe... Ahh, you know what?
    Fuhgeddaboudit.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Somebers</em> ain't just any puzzle, this one's got
    <em>some</em> numbers, ya know what I mean? Not all of 'em, not most of 'em,
    just the <em>right</em> ones. The rest? Fugazi.
  </p>
  <p>
    The board starts jam-packed with digits, but only some of them
    <s>some</s> sum up and belong in the final answer. Your job?
    <strong>Sniff out the keepers, whack the impostors</strong>.

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>One truth, one solution.</strong> Each puzzle has exactly
    <em>one</em> valid solution. Find it by pure deduction—no guessing needed.
  </div>

  <h2>🎯 The Goal</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Each <strong>row</strong> must add up to the gray number at the
      <strong>left</strong> of that row.
    </li>
    <li>
      Each <strong>column</strong> must add up to the gray number at the
      <strong>top</strong> of that column.
    </li>
    <li>
      Each <strong>color group</strong> must add up to the tiny number in that
      group's <strong>top-left cell</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>No mistakes!</strong> Every game can be solved with 0 mistakes, no
      guessing required.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="note">
    The correct solution is the <strong>only</strong> way to satisfy
    <em>all three</em> rules at once.
  </p>

  <h2>✋ Core Gameplay</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Start state:</strong> The grid shows numbers in every cell, but
      nothing is selected/circled yet.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Select required cells:</strong> <em>Tap</em> or
      <em>swipe up</em> a cell to <strong>select</strong> (circle) it — “this
      number <em>is</em> part of the solution.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Hide unused cells:</strong> <em>Double-tap</em> or
      <em>swipe down</em> (or <em>right-click</em> on desktop) to
      <strong>remove</strong> a number — “this number <em>is not</em> part of
      the solution.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Built-in feedback:</strong> If you try to keep a number that
      doesn't belong or remove a number that is required, the cell will shake,
      as if squirming under the pressure of being found out. The
      <strong>Mistakes</strong> counter will also increase with each mistake
      made.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>🖥️ / 👆 Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Mobile / Tablet</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Tap or <em>swipe up</em> → <strong>Select (circle)</strong> a number.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Double-tap</em> or <em>swipe down</em> → <strong>Remove</strong> a
          number.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Long-press</em> → <strong>Magnify</strong> cell content
          <span class="note"
            >(useful for viewing small text on smaller screens).</span
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Desktop</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="kbd">Click</span> → <strong>Select (circle)</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="kbd">Double-click</span> or
          <span class="kbd">Right-click</span> → <strong>Remove</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🧠 Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Easy eliminations:</strong> If a row must total
      <code class="kbd">2</code>, you can immediately hide any numbers larger
      than <code class="kbd">2</code> in that row.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cross-check both ways:</strong> A choice must fit the row
      <em>and</em> the column. If it breaks either total, it's out.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Leverage color groups:</strong> Use the group's tiny top-left
      total to lock in or eliminate cells inside that color.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>No guessing:</strong> Logical deduction will always get you to the
      unique solution.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🌟 The Big Picture</h2>
  <p>
    Think of it as Sudoku's cousin: instead of fitting numbers
    <em>into</em> cells, you're uncovering the <strong>truth</strong> about
    which existing numbers belong. Select what must remain, remove what cannot,
    and when rows, columns, and color groups all add up perfectly—you win. 🎉
