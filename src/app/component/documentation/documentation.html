    Welcome to <em>Some Numbers</em>, or as Tony calls 'em, "Somebers". Though
    that's usually only after he's had some be... Ahh, you know what?
    Fuhgeddaboudit.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Somebers</em> ain't just any puzzle, this one's got
    <em>some</em> numbers, ya know what I mean? Not all of 'em, not most of 'em,
    just the <em>right</em> ones. The rest? Fugazi.
  </p>
  <p>
    The board starts jam-packed with digits, but only some of them
    <s>some</s> sum up and belong in the final answer. Your job?
    <strong>Sniff out the keepers, whack the impostors</strong>.
  </p>
  <div class="callout">
    <strong>One truth, one solution.</strong> Each puzzle has exactly
    <em>one</em> valid solution. Find it by pure deduction—no guessing needed.
  </div>

  <h2>🎯 The Goal</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Each <strong>row</strong> must add up to the gray number at the
      <strong>left</strong> of that row.
    </li>
    <li>
      Each <strong>column</strong> must add up to the gray number at the
      <strong>top</strong> of that column.
    </li>
    <li>
      Each <strong>color group</strong> must add up to the tiny number in that
      group's <strong>top-left cell</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>No mistakes!</strong> Every game can be solved with 0 mistakes, no
      guessing required.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="note">
    The correct solution is the <strong>only</strong> way to satisfy
    <em>all three</em> rules at once.
  </p>

  <h2>✋ Core Gameplay</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Start state:</strong> The grid shows numbers in every cell, but
      nothing is selected/circled yet.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Select required cells:</strong> <em>Tap</em> or
      <em>swipe up</em> a cell to <strong>select</strong> (circle) it — “this
      number <em>is</em> part of the solution.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Hide unused cells:</strong> <em>Double-tap</em> or
      <em>swipe down</em> (or <em>right-click</em> on desktop) to
      <strong>remove</strong> a number — “this number <em>is not</em> part of
      the solution.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Built-in feedback:</strong> If you try to keep a number that
      doesn't belong or remove a number that is required, the cell will shake,
      as if squirming under the pressure of being found out. The
      <strong>Mistakes</strong> counter will also increase with each mistake
      made.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>🖥️ / 👆 Controls</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Tap or Swipe up → <strong>Select (circle)</strong> a number.</li>
        <li>Double-tap or Swipe down → <strong>Remove</strong> a number.</li>
        <li>
          Long-press → <strong>Magnify</strong> cell content

          <span class="note">
            (shows a red/white diamond as a visual marker).
          </span>
          Long-press a cell until the magnified view appears, then — without
          lifting your finger — slide slightly left or right to toggle the
          highlight on or off.

          </span>
          Click and hold until the magnified view appears, then — without
          releasing the mouse — drag slightly left or right to toggle the
          highlight on or off.

      </ul>

  <h2>🧠 Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Easy eliminations:</strong> If a row must total <code>2</code>,
      you can immediately hide any numbers larger than <code>2</code> in that
      row.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cross-check both ways:</strong> A choice must fit the row
      <em>and</em> the column. If it breaks either total, it's out.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Leverage color groups:</strong> Use the group's tiny top-left
      total to lock in or eliminate cells inside that color.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use temporary highlights:</strong> (see
      <code>Controls</code> section above) The red/white diamond is a quick,
      toggleable marker to help you keep track of numbers you're actively
      considering — especially useful during mental calculations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a id="scratch-pad"></a>
      <strong>Take advantage of the scratch pad:</strong> It's just a handy spot
      to park a single number, just like you would with pencil and paper. Nudge
      it up or down with the buttons, and double-click the value to reset it
      back to 10 when you want to start fresh.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>No guessing:</strong> Logical deduction will always get you to the
      unique solution.
    </li>

      • This warning appears on about 3.4% of boards. It indicates that a board
      cannot be solved using only <em>first-principles</em> logic (identifying
      required and unusable cells based solely on their presence in a row,
      column, or group). The <code>#-#</code> shown in the warning represents
      how many cells <code>[can't]-[can]</code> be determined with
      first-principles alone. Beyond that point, more advanced deduction methods
      are required to solve the board.

        </span>
        menu
      </span>
      • Ah yes, the Undo button — your safety net for when the game occasionally
      misreads a gesture (or when your finger slips because snacks are
      involved).
      <p>
        Sure, you <em>could</em> use it to quietly erase mistakes and stretch
        out that precious winning streak… but let's be honest, Tony's mom would
        roll her eyes and remind you: <q>You're only cheating yourself.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        So, use Undo when the game messes up. Abuse it, and hey — that victory
        will taste about as authentic as a dish of
        <em>tagliatelle al tartufo</em> from a gas station.

  <h2>🌟 The Big Picture</h2>
  <p>
    Think of it as Sudoku's more colorfully adorned cousin: instead of fitting
    numbers <em>into</em> cells, you're uncovering the
    <strong>truth</strong> about which existing numbers belong. Select what must
    remain, remove what cannot, and when rows, columns, and color groups all add
    up perfectly—you win. 🎉
