# TODO

- Green processing circle difficult to see on light theme
- ability to long press on a cell and see an expanded it for better visibility
- ability to pinch to zoom, even on game board controls
- record time spent per game
- tutorial mode
- sounds
- show game name somewhere on app / or an app game logo
- show hints for when people get stuck (Participation Trophy Mode)... though with infinite mistakes, is this necessary?
- current sum of selected cells in a color group, shown in top right corner perhaps
- configuration to be able to show/hide running calculated sums
- temp cell selection:
  - ability to highlight cells temporarily to mark that you're using them for mental math
  - cells are highlighted in consistent color depending on when they were highlighted
  - optionally do math for selected cells
- stats of fail counts based on grid size, time spent per game, per size
- ability to undo a move, IE un-hide a hidden number, or de-select a selected number
- Create a queue of pending moves and If one of the first moves fails, prevent failure of the others

# Done

- button appears to change to next game after game completion
- more polished way to ensure that temp UI state (if a cell is "processing", or should be wiggling etc) aren't persisted to storage
- tack "number of correct consecutive moves".
- track "percentage correct last 1k moves".
- show winning streak
- use .map as a copy constructor in board to ensure previous ui states aren't persisted
- shapes are hard to see.. make "light" part of shape transparent. ensure shape isn't over text
- color blind accessability
- add ability to clear all saved data.... new page / component with a text box that you have to type "delete everything" and click a button.
- persistence of previously played games
  - ability to partially solve a board, and save them for later
- sort affirmations based on number of mistakes
- click and partial drag on desktop doesn't clear animation
- animate changes, show some animation on initial tap to make the lag while waiting to see if a double tap is coming seem like it's part of the game
- clear formatting rows / columns / groups when all required cells are selected, and non-required cells are cleared. Possibly remove header value once a rows/column has been solved.
- investigate possibility that tapping is selecting a character... seems to be searching for "v" which may only be part of the version number display
- make game offline capable
- make game a PWA so it can be added to home screen
- app icon
- affirmation main text doesn't look great on ios
- make starting seed so that first few games are easy and progressively harder
- visual indication of failure moves
- ensure board display correctly on both portrait and landscape oriented devices
- explain how to play game
- dark/light/auto theme mode toggle
- weed out unsolvable games
- ensure every row/col/group has at least one required cell
- visually signal when game is complete
- buttons to change game number
- current sum of selected col/rows
- change the percent of numbers that are on the board (reduced to 40%)
